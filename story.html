  <p>At EducationNC, the hard work of audience engagement starts with Sergio Osnaya-Prieto‘s color-coded spreadsheet.</p>

  <p>The education reporting nonprofit’s mission is to reach people in all parts of the state – not just the metropolitan areas of Raleigh and Charlotte. Osnaya-Prieto’s spreadsheet tracks the implementation of new tactics to reach that goal. Green
    signifies a tactic that has been successfully implemented. Red is a rejected tactic. Yellow, Osnaya-Prieto’s self-professed favorite of the colors, means the tactic is under evaluation.</p>

  <p>“They sort of feel like puzzle pieces,” said Osnaya-Prieto, EdNC’s director of communications. “They might fit into what you’re doing, or they just might not.”</p>

  <p>As EdNC’s team learned, engagement journalism all comes down to finding the right puzzle pieces: it increased its established audience by 142 percent in 2020 and continued to grow in 2021.</p>

  <p>Now, EdNC is sharing its insights with the rest of the news industry. On Jan. 31, the outlet published a downloadable General Distribution and Engagement Playbook which details the tactics by which it grew its audience statewide. The playbook is
    unique in that it lays the groundwork for statewide engagement, as opposed to targeting a more niche audience.</p>

    Osnaya-Prieto is always excited to discover a new tool that could help EdNC in reaching its goals, but he maintains that it’s just as important to determine what doesn’t work for the organization.</p>

  <p>“Audience engagement seems to be kind of like an ever-changing ecosystem,” Osnaya-Prieto said. “It’s easy to sort of get caught up in trends… but it’s really much more important to evaluate how those trends fit into your organization.”</p>

  <p>In recent years, “engagement” has become somewhat of a buzzword in the journalism industry, especially as outlets have looked to grow their audience through social media and other forms of digital communication.</p>

  <p>Engagement requires thinking of journalism as a service rather than a product, said Carrie Brown, director of the Engagement Journalism program at the City University of New York’s Craig Newmark School of Journalism. As advertising revenue
    declines, news outlets must develop a closer relationship with their readers to remain viable.</p>

  <p>“You really need to understand how to serve people better, because you’re asking them for their money or their attention, so that is a very different business proposition,” Brown said. “I think a lot of these newer digital outlets that are
    popping up, many of them do have engagement kind of baked into their DNA.”</p>
